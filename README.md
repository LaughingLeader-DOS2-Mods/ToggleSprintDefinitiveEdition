Toggle Sprint Definitive Edition for Divinity: Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition
=======

Toggle Sprint is a quality-of-life mod that features increased, fully-customizable running speeds for both the party and NPCs in combat.

# Features:
* A fully reworked sprinting system. Choose your own speed!
* Sprinting no longer affects combat movement costs, and is thus enabled in combat.
* NPC running and walking speeds for combat can be configured, greatly speeding up battles.
* Choose from a set of preset configurations when opening the settings menu for the first time. No need to get lost in menus and options.
* A variety of options available in the settings menu.
	* Sprinting speeds can be set for the whole party (by the host), with the option for individual characters to set their own speed.
	* Enemy sprinting and walking speeds can be set.
	* The sprinting status can be made hidden, giving you some UI space if you tend to have too many statuses going on.
* [LeaderLib](https://github.com/LaughingLeader-DOS2-Mods/LeaderLib/releases/tag/mod-releases) mod menu support.

## Note:
Toggle Sprint DE speeds up characters in a way that doesn't affect movement cost in battle, so speeding up enemies has no tactical disadvantage, as it purely affects the time it takes to get from A to B.
