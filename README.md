Toggle Sprint Definitive Edition for Divinity: Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition
=======

Toggle Sprint is a quality-of-life mod that features increased, fully-customizable running speeds that may be toggled at will. Additionally, enemy running and walking speeds can be set, greatly speeding up battles.

# Features:
* A fully reworded sprinting system. Choose your own speed!
* Sprinting no longer affects combat movement costs, and is thus enabled in combat.
* Enemies can be made to sprint in combat, to greatly speed up battles.
* Choose from a set of preset configurations when opening the settings menu for the first time. No need to get lost in menus and options.
* A variety of options available in the settings menu.
	* Sprinting speeds can be set for the whole party (by the host), with the option for individual characters to set their own speed.
	* Enemy sprinting and walking speeds can be set.
	* The sprinting status can be made hidden, giving you some UI space if you tend to have too many statuses going on.
* [LeaderLib](https://github.com/LaughingLeader-DOS2-Mods/LeaderLib/releases/tag/Mod-Release) mod menu support.
